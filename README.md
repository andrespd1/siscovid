## What is this? 

This is data analysis and visualization for the "Epidemiological Intelligent System for the COVID-19" project. The project was developed for a research project assigned by the Universidad de los Andes, and I helped at the start of the project by making hotfixes that allowed the project to support the changes that the data was receiving due to the constant changes in the structure of the data that the Secretaria de Salud of Bogot√° was doing (a public institution of the government).

## What we have used to built this app?

- Python Jupyter Notebooks
